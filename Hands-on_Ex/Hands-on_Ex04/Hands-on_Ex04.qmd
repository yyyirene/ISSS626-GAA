# **Spatial Weights and Applications**

## **8.1 Overview**

In this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to compute spatial weights using R. By the end to this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:

-   import geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of **sf** package,

-   import csv file using appropriate function of **readr** package,

-   perform relational join using appropriate join function of **dplyr** package,

-   compute spatial weights using appropriate functions of **spdep** package, and

-   calculate spatially lagged variables using appropriate functions of **spdep** package.

## **8.2 The Study Area and Data**

Two data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:

-   Hunan county boundary layer. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.

-   Hunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunan’s local development indicators in 2012.

### **8.2.1 Getting Started**

Before we get started, we need to ensure that spdep, sf, tmap and tidyverse packages of R are currently installed in your R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse, knitr)
```

## 8.3 Getting the Data Into R Environment

In this section, we will learn how to bring a geospatial data and its associated attribute table into R environment. The geospatial data is in ESRI shapefile format and the attribute table is in csv fomat.

### 8.3.1 Import shapefile into r environment

The code chunk below uses st_read() of sf package to import Hunan shapefile into R. The imported shapefile will be simple features Object of sf.

```{r}
hunan <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                 layer = "Hunan")
```

### 8.3.2 Import csv file into r environment

Next, we will import Hunan_2012.csv into R by using read_csv() of readr package. The output is R dataframe class.

```{r}
hunan2012 <- read_csv("data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv")
```

### 8.3.3 Performing relational join

The code chunk below will be used to update the attribute table of hunan’s SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with the attribute fields of hunan2012 dataframe. This is performed by using left_join() of dplyr package.

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan,hunan2012)%>%
  select(1:4, 7, 15)
```

From the out put ,they will return a data frame that contains only columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 15 from the hunan data frame after the left_join operation.

## 8.4 Visualising Regional Development Indicator

```{r}
names(hunan)
```

```{r}
basemap <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_text("NAME_3", size=0.5)

gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC")
tmap_arrange(basemap, gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

## 8.5 Computing Contiguity Spatial Weights

In this section, we will learn how to use poly2nb() of spdep package to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. If we look at the documentation we will see that we can pass a “queen” argument that takes TRUE or FALSE as options. If we do not specify this argument the default is set to TRUE, that is, if we don’t specify queen = FALSE this function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria.

### 8.5.1 Computing (QUEEN) contiguity based neighbours

```{r}
wm_q <- poly2nb(hunan, queen=TRUE)
summary(wm_q)
```

The summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one heighbours.

```{r}
wm_q[[1]]
```

The neighbors of the first polygon are polygons 2, 3, 4, 57, and 85

We can retrive the county name of Polygon ID=1 by using the code chunk below:

```{r}
hunan$County[1]
```

The county name of the first polygon is "Anxiang"

To reveal the county names of the five neighboring polygons, the code chunk will be used:

```{r}
hunan$NAME_3[c(2,3,4,57,85)]
```

The name of the first polygon (region) neighbor

```{r}
nb1 <- wm_q[[1]]
nb1 <- hunan$GDPPC[nb1]
nb1
```

The printed output above shows that the GDPPC of the five nearest neighbours based on Queen’s method are 20981, 34592, 24473, 21311 and 22879 respectively.

Display the complete weight matrix by using str().

```{r}
str(wm_q)
```

Neighbors of 1: \$ : int \[1:5\] 2 3 4 57 85 means that the first polygon has 5 neighbors, which are polygons numbered 2, 3, 4, 57, and 85.

Neighbors of 2: \$ : int \[1:5\] 1 57 58 78 85 means that the second polygon has 5 neighbors, which are polygons numbered 1, 57, 58, 78, and 85.

### 8.5.2 Creating (ROOK) contiguity based neighbours

```{r}
wm_r <- poly2nb(hunan, queen=FALSE)
summary(wm_r)
```

The summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connect area unit has 10 neighbours. There are two area units with only one heighbours.

### 8.5.3 Visualising contiguity weights

To get our longitude values we map the st_centroid function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation \[\[\]\] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.

```{r}
longitude <- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])
```

We do the same for latitude with one key difference. We access the second value per each centroid with \[\[2\]\].

```{r}
latitude <- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])
```

Now that we have latitude and longitude, we use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object.

```{r}
coords <- cbind(longitude, latitude)
```

We check the first few observations to see if things are formatted correctly.

```{r}
head(coords)
```

#### 8.5.3.1 Plotting Queen contiguity based neighbours map

```{r}
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey")
plot(wm_q, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= "red")
```

#### 8.5.3.2 Plotting Rook contiguity based neighbours map

```{r}
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey")
plot(wm_r, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = "red")
```

#### 8.5.3.3 Plotting both Queen and Rook contiguity based neighbours maps

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey", main="Queen Contiguity")
plot(wm_q, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= "red")
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey", main="Rook Contiguity")
plot(wm_r, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = "red")
```

## 8.6 Computing distance based neighbours

In this section, we will learn how to derive distance-based weight matrices by using dnearneigh() of spdep package.

The function identifies neighbours of region points by Euclidean distance with a distance band with lower d1= and upper d2= bounds controlled by the bounds= argument. If unprojected coordinates are used and either specified in the coordinates object x or with x as a two column matrix and longlat=TRUE, great circle distances in km will be calculated assuming the WGS84 reference ellipsoid.

### 8.6.1 Determine the cut-off distance

Firstly, we need to determine the upper limit for distance band by using the steps below:

Return a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using knearneigh() of spdep. Convert the knn object returned by knearneigh() into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb(). Return the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists() of spdep. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise. Remove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist().

```{r}
#coords <- coordinates(hunan)
k1 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))
k1dists <- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))
summary(k1dists)
```

The summary report shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km, so using this as the upper threshold gives certainty that all units will have at least one neighbour.

### 8.6.2 Computing fixed distance weight matrix

```{r}
wm_d62 <- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 62, longlat = TRUE)
wm_d62
```

The "Average number of links: 3.681818" shown in the output refers to the average number of neighboring regions (or connections) that each region has in the spatial neighbor list.

Next, we will use str() to display the content of wm_d62 weight matrix.

```{r}
str(wm_d62)
```

Another way to display the structure of the weight matrix is to combine table() and card() of spdep.

```{r}
table(hunan$County, card(wm_d62))
```

```{r}
n_comp <- n.comp.nb(wm_d62)
n_comp$nc
```

```{r}
table(n_comp$comp.id)
```

#### 8.6.2.1 Plotting fixed distance weight matrix

Next, we will plot the distance weight matrix by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey")
plot(wm_d62, coords, add=TRUE)
plot(k1, coords, add=TRUE, col="red", length=0.08)
```

The red lines show the links of 1st nearest neighbours and the black lines show the links of neighbours within the cut-off distance of 62km.

Alternatively, we can plot both of them next to each other by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey", main="1st nearest neighbours")
plot(k1, coords, add=TRUE, col="red", length=0.08)
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey", main="Distance link")
plot(wm_d62, coords, add=TRUE, pch = 19, cex = 0.6)

```

### 8.6.3 Computing adaptive distance weight matrix

One of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.

It is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
knn6 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=6))
```

```{r}
knn6
```

```{r}
str(knn6)
```

8.6.3.1 Plotting distance based neighbours We can plot the weight matrix using the code chunk below.

```{r}
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey")
plot(knn6, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = "red")
```

## 8.7 Weights based on IDW

In this section, you will learn how to derive a spatial weight matrix based on Inversed Distance method.

First, we will compute the distances between areas by using nbdists() of spdep.

```{r}
dist <- nbdists(wm_q, coords, longlat = TRUE)
ids <- lapply(dist, function(x) 1/(x))
ids
```

## 8.8 Row-standardised Weights Matrix

Next, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summaries the neighbors’ values it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.

```{r}
rswm_q <- nb2listw(wm_q, style="W", zero.policy = TRUE)
rswm_q
```

```{r}
rswm_q$weights[10]
```

This code shows the neighbor weights of polygon 10. The output shows that the polygon has 8 neighbors, each with a weight of 0.125. This means that when R computes the average neighboring income values, each neighbor’s income will be multiplied by 0.125 before being tallied.

```{r}
rswm_ids <- nb2listw(wm_q, glist=ids, style="B", zero.policy=TRUE)
rswm_ids
```

```{r}
rswm_ids$weights[1]
```

```{r}
summary(unlist(rswm_ids$weights))
```

## 8.9 Application of Spatial Weight Matrix

In this section, you will learn how to create four different spatial lagged variables, they are:

spatial lag with row-standardized weights, spatial lag as a sum of neighbouring values, spatial window average, and spatial window sum.

### 8.9.1 Spatial lag with row-standardized weights

Finally, we’ll compute the average neighbor GDPPC value for each polygon. These values are often referred to as spatially lagged values.

```{r}
GDPPC.lag <- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)
GDPPC.lag
```

```{r}
rswm_ids <- nb2listw(wm_q, glist=ids, style="B", zero.policy=TRUE)
rswm_ids
```

wm_q: neighbor list, indicating the adjacency of spatial units.

glist=ids: The glist parameter is used to specify a list containing distance weights. In the previous calculation, ids is a list containing the inverse distance (weight) of each polygon to its neighbors.

style="B": Set the normalization method of weights. "B" means basic weight, that is, directly use the specified weight value without normalization.

zero.policy=TRUE: Allow areas without neighbors to exist to prevent errors caused by lack of neighbors.

Recalled in the previous section, we retrieved the GDPPC of these five countries by using the code chunk below

```{r}
nb1 <- wm_q[[1]]
nb1 <- hunan$GDPPC[nb1]
nb1
```

Row-normalized weights ensure that the neighbors of each region have an equal impact on its spatial lag. This has the benefit of avoiding bias in the calculation of spatial lags when the number of neighbors is different.

We can append the spatially lag GDPPC values onto hunan sf data frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
lag.list <- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC))
lag.res <- as.data.frame(lag.list)
colnames(lag.res) <- c("NAME_3", "lag GDPPC")
hunan <- left_join(hunan,lag.res)
```

The following table shows the average neighboring income values (stored in the Inc.lag object) for each county.

```{r}
head(hunan)
```

Next, we will plot both the GDPPC and spatial lag GDPPC for comparison using the code chunk below.

```{r}
gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC")
lag_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "lag GDPPC")
tmap_arrange(gdppc, lag_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

### 8.9.2 Spatial lag as a sum of neighboring values

We can calculate spatial lag as a sum of neighboring values by assigning binary weights. This requires us to go back to our neighbors list, then apply a function that will assign binary weights, then we use glist = in the nb2listw function to explicitly assign these weights.

We start by applying a function that will assign a value of 1 per each neighbor. This is done with lapply, which we have been using to manipulate the neighbors structure throughout the past notebooks. Basically it applies a function across each value in the neighbors structure.

```{r}
b_weights <- lapply(wm_q, function(x) 0*x + 1)
b_weights2 <- nb2listw(wm_q, 
                       glist = b_weights, 
                       style = "B")
b_weights2
```

```{r}
lag_sum <- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(b_weights2, hunan$GDPPC))
lag.res <- as.data.frame(lag_sum)
colnames(lag.res) <- c("NAME_3", "lag_sum GDPPC")
```

First, let us examine the result by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
lag_sum
```

Next, we will append the lag_sum GDPPC field into hunan sf data frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan, lag.res)
```

```{r}
gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC")
lag_sum_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "lag_sum GDPPC")
tmap_arrange(gdppc, lag_sum_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

### 8.9.3 Spatial window average

The spatial window average uses row-standardized weights and includes the diagonal element. To do this in R, we need to go back to the neighbors structure and add the diagonal element before assigning weights.

To add the diagonal element to the neighbour list, we just need to use include.self() from spdep.

```{r}
wm_qs <- include.self(wm_q)
```

Notice that the Number of nonzero links, Percentage nonzero weights and Average number of links are 536, 6.921488 and 6.090909 respectively as compared to wm_q of 448, 5.785124 and 5.090909

Let us take a good look at the neighbour list of area \[1\] by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
wm_qs[[1]]
```

Notice that now \[1\] has six neighbours instead of five.

Now we obtain weights with nb2listw()

```{r}
wm_qs <- nb2listw(wm_qs)
wm_qs
```

Again, we use nb2listw() and glist() to explicitly assign weight values.

Lastly, we just need to create the lag variable from our weight structure and GDPPC variable.

```{r}
lag_w_avg_gpdpc <- lag.listw(wm_qs, 
                             hunan$GDPPC)
lag_w_avg_gpdpc
```

Next, we will convert the lag variable listw object into a data.frame by using as.data.frame().

```{r}
lag.list.wm_qs <- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(wm_qs, hunan$GDPPC))
lag_wm_qs.res <- as.data.frame(lag.list.wm_qs)
colnames(lag_wm_qs.res) <- c("NAME_3", "lag_window_avg GDPPC")
```

Note: The third command line on the code chunk above renames the field names of lag_wm_q1.res object into NAME_3 and lag_window_avg GDPPC respectively.

Next, the code chunk below will be used to append lag_window_avg GDPPC values onto hunan sf data.frame by using left_join() of dplyr package.

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan, lag_wm_qs.res)
```

```{r}
hunan %>%
  select("County", 
         "lag GDPPC", 
         "lag_window_avg GDPPC") %>%
  kable()
```

Lastly, qtm() of tmap package is used to plot the lag_gdppc and w_ave_gdppc maps next to each other for quick comparison.

```{r}
w_avg_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "lag_window_avg GDPPC")
tmap_arrange(lag_gdppc, w_avg_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

### 8.9.4 Spatial window sum

The spatial window sum is the counter part of the window average, but without using row-standardized weights.

To add the diagonal element to the neighbour list, we just need to use include.self() from spdep.

```{r}
wm_qs <- include.self(wm_q)
wm_qs
```

```{r}
b_weights <- lapply(wm_qs, function(x) 0*x + 1)
b_weights[1]
```

Notice that now \[1\] has six neighbours instead of five.

Again, we use nb2listw() and glist() to explicitly assign weight values.

```{r}
b_weights2 <- nb2listw(wm_qs, 
                       glist = b_weights, 
                       style = "B")
b_weights2
```

With our new weight structure, we can compute the lag variable with lag.listw().

```{r}
w_sum_gdppc <- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(b_weights2, hunan$GDPPC))
w_sum_gdppc
```

Next, we will convert the lag variable listw object into a data.frame by using as.data.frame().

```{r}
w_sum_gdppc.res <- as.data.frame(w_sum_gdppc)
colnames(w_sum_gdppc.res) <- c("NAME_3", "w_sum GDPPC")
```

Note: The second command line on the code chunk above renames the field names of w_sum_gdppc.res object into NAME_3 and w_sum GDPPC respectively.

Next, the code chunk below will be used to append w_sum GDPPC values onto hunan sf data.frame by using left_join() of dplyr package.

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan, w_sum_gdppc.res)
```

Lastly, qtm() of tmap package is used to plot the lag_sum GDPPC and w_sum_gdppc maps next to each other for quick comparison.

```{r}
colnames(hunan)
```

```{r}
hunan %>%
  select("County", "lag_sum GDPPC", "w_sum GDPPC") %>%
  kable()
```

```{r}
w_sum_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "w_sum GDPPC")
tmap_arrange(lag_sum_gdppc, w_sum_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```
